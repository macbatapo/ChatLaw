You can use the information icon to select which information you want to see on the map, such as speed limits, street names, points of interest, and more. You can also use the directional icon to switch between different map modes, such as 2D, 3D, perspective, or arrow view. You can also zoom in or out, rotate, or tilt the map to get a better view of your surroundings.
