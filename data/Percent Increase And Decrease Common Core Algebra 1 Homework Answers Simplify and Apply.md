# How to Solve Problems Involving Percent Increase and Decrease in Common Core Algebra 1
 
Percent increase and decrease are common concepts in algebra that involve finding how much a quantity changes relative to its original value. For example, if a shirt costs $20 and then goes on sale for $15, what is the percent decrease in the price of the shirt?
 
To answer this question, we need to use the following formula:

**Percent change = (amount of change / original amount) x 100%**
 
The amount of change is the difference between the new value and the original value. In this case, the amount of change is $15 - $20 = -$5. The original amount is the value before the change. In this case, the original amount is $20. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:
 
Percent change = (-$5 / $20) x 100%
 
Percent change = -0.25 x 100%
 
Percent change = -25%
 
A negative percent change means a decrease, so the price of the shirt decreased by 25%. If we want to find the percent increase or decrease of any quantity, we can use the same formula with the appropriate values.

In Common Core Algebra 1, you will learn how to apply this formula to various problems involving percent increase and decrease. You will also learn how to use proportions, similar figures, and percents to model real-world situations. For example, you will learn how to find the missing dimension of a scale drawing, how to compare two quantities using ratios and rates, and how to calculate interest rates and exponential growth or decay.

One of the applications of percent increase and decrease is finding the final amount after a series of changes. For example, suppose you invest $1000 in a bank account that pays 5% interest compounded annually. How much money will you have after 3 years?
 
To answer this question, we need to use the following formula:
 
**Final amount = initial amount x (1 + percent change)^number of times^**
 
The initial amount is the value before any changes. In this case, the initial amount is $1000. The percent change is the rate of change per time period, expressed as a decimal. In this case, the percent change is 5% or 0.05. The number of times is how many times the change occurs. In this case, the change occurs once per year, so the number of times is 3. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:
 
Final amount = $1000 x (1 + 0.05)^3^
 
Final amount = $1000 x 1.05^3^
 
Final amount = $1000 x 1.157625
 
Final amount = $1157.63
 
So, after 3 years, you will have $1157.63 in your account.
  
Another application of percent increase and decrease is finding the original amount before a change. For example, suppose a shirt is on sale for $18 and this represents a 40% discount from the original price. What was the original price of the shirt?
 
To answer this question, we need to use the following formula:
 
**Original amount = final amount / (1 + percent change)**
 
The final amount is the value after the change. In this case, the final amount is $18. The percent change is the rate of change relative to the original amount, expressed as a decimal. In this case, the percent change is -40% or -0.4. A negative percent change means a decrease. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:
 
Original amount = $18 / (1 - 0.4)
 
Original amount = $18 / 0.6
 
Original amount = $30
 
So, the original price of the shirt was $30.
